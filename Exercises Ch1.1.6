1.1.6
Conditional Expressions and Predicates

Ways to perform different operations based on the results of a test
|x| = { x if x > 0 
        0 if x = 0 
        -x if x < 0

This construct is called a case analysis, and it is called cond in
Lisp (for "conditional")

(define (abs x)
  (cond ((> x 0) x)
        ((= x 0) 0)
        ((< x 0) (-x))))

Parenthesized pairs ((p) (e)) are called clauses.
The first expression, called a predicate, is evaluated to be true
or false. Then this continues until a predicate is found to be
true.

There are also logical composition operations such as "and", "or",
and "not".
